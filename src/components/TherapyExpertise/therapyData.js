      content: "Lymphatic Drainage Massage uses gentle, rhythmic movements to stimulate lymph flow, reduce fluid retention, and support immune function. By following the natural direction of lymph circulation, it helps decrease post-surgical swelling, treat lymphedema, improve detoxification, and provide deep relaxation. This therapy enhances recovery, promotes tissue healing, and supports overall wellness after surgery."

      content: "Tecar / Cret Therapy (Capacitive and Resistive Energy Transfer) applies high-frequency energy to target both soft tissues (muscles, ligaments) and dense tissues (bones, tendons, joints). This non-invasive treatment generates deep heat within tissues, improving blood flow, reducing inflammation, relaxing muscles, and stimulating cellular regeneration. It is highly effective for musculoskeletal pain, sports injuries, arthritis, back and neck pain, tendon injuries, and post-surgical rehabilitation."
